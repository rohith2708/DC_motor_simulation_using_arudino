# DC_motor_simulation_using_arudino
Simulation is done in Tkinter with supply from 9v battery and converting the output using LM7805 regulator and connecting pwm and input/output signals of arduino uno with the L293D motor controller and practice motor, with pwm pins connected with the oscilloscope for simulation.
